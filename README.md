## Predicting Fashion Styles using a Multimodal Approach with Instant Onboarding

Fashion recommendation systems should not just be collaborative but should also take content into account. We propose
a novel fashion style predictor based on a multimodal set of features including visual, textual and user information to
train a classier. While most style predictors have a long onboarding process where they ask a series of questions and
risk incorrect self assessment by the user, ours is an almost instant onboarding process. We latently infer a user’s styles
using her rich social network data that is already available
